# ZX81 Game Framework
ZX81 machine code program framework. You know, for games.

My aim with this project is to give something that will be useful for those wanting to get going with developing software on the little black door wedge. People who don't want to get bogged down in the minutiae of building the supporting framework for their great idea.

There will be a number of different versions of the framework, of increasing degrees of sophistication. I will organise these releases into branches or perhaps releases. 

The documentation aims to describe some of the features of the framework and the code that goes into it, but it's not going to be a tutorial. You will still need to be working out the details.

For the nasty details [go and visit this repo's wiki](https://github.com/charlierobson/zx81gameframe/wiki/A_MAIN).
